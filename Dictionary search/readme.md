## Dictionary search

### Objective
To construct a Trie data structure that can store all words in the dictionary. Each entree will 
be a single word in an input.txt file. 

Once the data structure has been constructed, the next step would be to make UI which allows the user
to perform intelligent search. This process involves:

1. User keys in a word and the displayed list of words will update per click
2. If there is no other possible combination of words, the system will return the only word possible
3. Flagging of invalid entrees
