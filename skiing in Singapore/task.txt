As a short description, you are given a M x N map of integers. You may pick any point on the map to start 
and you can only move if to a new point only if it has a value less than your current value. Your movements 
are also limited to left / right / up / down. 

The goal is to find a starting point that will lead to you a local minima while taking the longest route possible. 

*I'm assuming that we should end up only at a local minima since the problem did not mention that we have to end up 
at a global minima.

Solution:
Two solutions came to my mind. 

1) The first is to brute force your way by performing depth / breath first search over the entire 
map, assuming that you start at each i,j location. That should give you the longest path possible but will take a long amount of time.
Also, brute forcing is probably a bad idea for most questions on the net :/

2) The second solution combines depth first search with dynamic programmming. We maintain 3 2D-arrays, one to store the actual map itself,
one to store the cost of a certain point on the map and one to keep track if that location has been explored. 

Assume that we start at an arbitraty location i,j. We first attempt to explore all of our 4 directions starting from top / right / bottom / left.
We check to see if that location has already been explored. If it hasn't, we recursively explore depth first until we hit a local minima to which there are no
other means of exploring further. We then return up the chain, this time exploring other directions. Each time we recurse, our cost in that direction is incremented
by 1. At the very end, we take the max of all possible directions we can move in and pass that score up the chain.

Dynamic programming is applied when we register that we have explored a certain location. Since our recursive technique above returns the highest costing path for 
that location (which means the longest possible path value), we can simply return that value from our cost array, increment it by 1 and store that as the cost value 
for our current position. 

We traverse through each possible location on the map and apply the logic above. At the end, we will have a 2D cost array of integers that represents the longest
possible path you can take should you start at any i,j location. We then find the maxinum value over the entire array and pick the integer which is the highest.

To find the longest route, we note that each time we move across that route, the cost will decrease by 1. This is because we incremented an adjacent location by
a value of 1 during our recursion process. We begin at our starting location and search for a cost value that is 1 less than its current value. We move down until 
we cannot find another suitable direction. From here, the algortihm ends.

*Note that we do not need to worry about being trapped in a circular loop during recursion since our criteria for exploring a new adjacent location is based strictly
on the fact that that location must be smaller in value than our current location. That means that if you are allowed to move down 1 square, you should not be allowed
to move up to or find yourself reaching that same square again.
