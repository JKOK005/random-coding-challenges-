### Compiling and run on windows
The main entry script is SkiingInSingapore.java

First, compile using
```
javac SkiingInSingapore.java
```

Then run the script with the input.txt piped in. Input.txt contains the full M x N map values. 
```
cmd /c --% java SkiingInSingapore < input.txt

You should see outputs to the console as such:
	Longest path: xx
